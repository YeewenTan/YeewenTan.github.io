# How Do I Start Using Deep Learning?

Where you start depends on what you already know. 

The prerequisites for understanding and applying deep learning are linear algebra, calculus and statistics, as well as programming and machine learning. 

In the case of Deeplearning4j, you should know Java well and be comfortable with the IntelliJ IDE. 

Below you'll find a list of resources. The sections are roughly organized in the order they will be useful. 

## Free Machine- and Deep-learning Courses Online

* [Andrew Ng's Machine-Learning Class on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info) 
* [Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks Class on Coursera](http://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/lecture) 
* [Patrick Winston's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence @MIT](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/) (For those interested in a survey of artificial intelligence.)
* [Andrej Karpathy's Convolutional Neural Networks Class at Stanford](http://cs231n.github.io) (For those interested in image recognition.)

## Math

* [Andrew Ng's 6-Part Review of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnnr1O8OWc6boN4WHeuisJWmeQHH9D_Vg)
* [Khan Academy's Linear Algebra Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
* [Linear Algebra for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZumgfOei0Ak); Patrick van der Smagt
* [CMU's Linear Algebra Review](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/linalg/outline.html)
* [Math for Machine Learning](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/courses/2013S_ML/math4ml.pdf)
* [Immersive Linear Algebra](http://immersivemath.com/ila/learnmore.html)
* [Probability Cheatsheet](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54bf3241e4b0f0d81bf7ff36/t/55e9494fe4b011aed10e48e5/1441352015658/probability_cheatsheet.pdf)

* [An Introduction to MCMC for Machine Learning](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.13.7133&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

## Programming

If you do not know how to program yet, you shouldn't start with Java. Python and Ruby convey the basic ideas much more easily in a faster feedback loop. 

* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)
* [Learn to Program (Ruby)](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)
* [Intro to the Command Line](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
* [Additional command-line tutorial](http://www.learnenough.com/command-line)
* [A Vim Tutorial and Primer](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/) (Vim is an editor accessible from the command line.)
* [Intro to Computer Science (CS50 @Harvard edX)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
* [A Gentle Introduction to Machine Fundamentals](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/turtle/)

If you want to jump into deep-learning from here without Java, we recommend [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/) and the various Python frameworks built atop it, including [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) and [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne).

## Java

Once you have programming basics down, tackle Java, the world's most widely used programming language, and the language of Hadoop. 

* [Java Resources](http://wiht.link/java-resources)
* [Java Ranch: A Community for Java Beginners](http://javaranch.com/)
* [Intro to Programming in Java @Princeton](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/)
* [Head First Java](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009208)
* [Java in a Nutshell](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449370829)

## Deeplearning4j

With that under your belt, we recommend you approach Deeplearning4j through its [examples](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples). 

* [Quickstart](./quickstart.html)

Once you get those up and running, and you've understood the API, you're ready for a full install.

* [Getting Started](./gettingstarted)

## Other Resources

Most of what we know about deep learning is contained in academic papers.

We've linked to a number of them [here](./deeplearningpapers). 

While individual courses have limits on what they can teach, the Internet does not. Most math and programming questions can be answered by Googling and searching sites like [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and [Math Stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/).
