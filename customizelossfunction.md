# Customized Loss Functions With DL4J

*This documentation page is a WIP.*

To customize a loss function, define an optimization function that generates a `gradient()`.

The relevant code can be found [here](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-core/src/test/java/org/deeplearning4j/optimize/solver/TestOptimizers.java#L702).
