# DL4J Model Zoo

Similar to Caffe's model zoo, this repository provides common model configurations. Currently, it contains computer vision configurations:

* [AlexNet](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-model-z/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/AlexNet.java)
* [LeNet](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-model-z/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/LeNet.java)
* [VGGNetA](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-model-z/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/VGGNetA.java)
* [VGGNetD](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-model-z/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/VGGNetD.java)
* [GoogleLeNet](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-model-z/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/GoogleLeNet.java)

The configurations will give you a headstart when creating models for image recognition. The plans are to also add pretrained models to our model zoo, and we welcome contributions.
