# Linear Classifier Tutorial

This tutorial will show you how to solve a binary classification problem with Deeplearning4j: 

Given TK data such as TK (the input variables), you'll train a neural network to predict whether or not a given instances belongs to one group or the other. 

You'll train a logistic regression model, and based on the input, the model will output a number between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability that the data instance belongs to the TK group.

## Setup

First, install Deeplearning4j and its examples by follow the [Quickstart instructions](./quickstart).

## The Dataset

## Turning Data Into Vectors
