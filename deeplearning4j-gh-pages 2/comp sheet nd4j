1) basic data type is a java object. not first class data types in java. we rolled our own. you can treat an ndarray as a matrix
2) we're 0-based indexing like numpy
3) java is meant for enterprise environments. has the fastest optimized runtime. ecosystem for distributed tools like hadoop, akka. works with scala and clojure and other jvm languages. 
4) pass-by-reference: pass an array into a function, i can actually change the array. our views are slice operations.
5) java has a built in package manager and ways of managing large hierarchies of code. unlike python, we have ways of static typing. scales to larger code bases. built in safeguards for compiler.
6) community: started with DL4J. growing. google group. 
7) like SLF4J, we're a baseline tool for various sorts of matrix backends like GPUs and native Blas.
8) we don't do plotting or viz. delegate to matplotlib.
9) eclipse and intelliJ are suggested for development. 
10) free in the double sense. apache licensed.
